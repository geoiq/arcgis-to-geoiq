arc-to-geoiq

A library that will pull data from an ArcGIS REST services and add them as a 
layer in a GeoIQ server. It can also download the data from the ArcGIS server
and save the data to a csv file called output.csv.

See the sample_utility for an example on how to use the library. It gives 
and example for both dumping the data to csv and uploading to GeoIq.

There is a limit to the size of the file that can be uploaded to GeoIQ. This
limit is set in lib/arc-to-geoiq.rb file by setting the GEOIQ_UPLOAD_LIMIT 
constant. The library keeps track of the size of the data. If the data
exceeds the limit, it will raise a RuntimeError with the message: "Size of data exceeds GeoIq upload limit".

To be able to retrieve data from ArcGIS REST services, the ArcGIS server
must support layer queries. It also must support "greater than" queries (as 
in OBJECTID > 23).  Unless these two conditions are met, the library
can't retrieve information. If the library can't retrieve data, it will 
throw Runtime errors with the messages "Query clause not supported" or 
"Layer doesn't support query".

Due to data retrieving limitations of ArcGIS, we can only download 500 records
at a time.

Some layers in ArcGIS REST services lack geometry columns. When this happens, a RuntimeError with the message "The layer lacks a geometry field" is raised.

While uploading to GeoIq, if there are missing credentials, the library will
throw an ArgumentError containing in its message the missing parameter.

The library will raise an error if the GeoIq server sends back an http status
code above 400.

For the functional tests to work, please add a valid GeoIQ server, user name
and password.
